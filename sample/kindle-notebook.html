    I.  THE PATH TO FOLLOW

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 1. First Passion, Then Training  > Page 25 · Location 155
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    put passion ahead of training. Feel out in any way you can what you most want to do in science, or technology, or some other science-related profession. Obey that passion as long as it lasts. Feed it with the knowledge the mind needs to grow. Sample other subjects, acquire a general education in science, and be smart enough to switch to a greater love if one appears. But don’t just drift through courses in science hoping that love will come to you. Maybe it will, but don’t take the chance. As in other big choices in your life, there is too much at stake. Decision and hard work based on enduring passion will never fail you.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 3. The Path to Follow > Page 47 · Location 354
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    This brings me to the ways in which scientific problems are found and discoveries made. Scientists, mathematicians among them, follow one of two pathways. First, early in the research a problem is identified, and then a solution is sought. The problem may be relatively small (for example, what is the average life span of a Nile crocodile?) or large (what is the role of dark matter in the universe?). As an answer emerges, other phenomena are typically discovered, and other questions raised. The second strategy is to study a subject broadly, while searching for any previously unknown or even unimagined phenomena.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 3. The Path to Follow > Page 48 · Location 363
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Obviously, both strategies can be followed, together or in sequence, but by and large scientists who use the first strategy are instinctive problem solvers. They are prone by taste and talent to select a particular kind of organism, or chemical compound, or elementary particle, or physical process, to answer questions about its properties and roles in nature. Such is the predominant research activity in the physical sciences and molecular biology.

    The potential paths you can follow with a scientific career are vast in number. Your choice may take you into one of the scenarios I’ve described, or not. The subject for you, as in any true love, is one in which you are interested and that stirs passion and promises pleasure from a lifetime of devotion.

<div class="noteText">
    isn’t the cutting edge a place only for geniuses? No, fortunately. Work accomplished on the frontier defines genius, not just getting there. In fact, both accomplishments along the frontier and the final eureka moment are achieved more by entrepreneurship and hard work than by native intelligence.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. What It Takes  > Page 79 · Location 630
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Being bright, then, is just not enough for those who dream of success in scientific research. Mathematical fluency is not enough. To reach and stay at the frontier, a strong work ethic is absolutely essential. There must be an ability to pass long hours in study and research with pleasure even though some of the effort will inevitably lead to dead ends. Such is the price of admission to the first rank of research scientists.

    you will find friends among your fellow enthusiasts and experts. Daily satisfaction from what you are doing will be one of your rewards, but of equal importance is the esteem of people you respect. Yet another is the recognition that what you find will uniquely benefit humanity.

<div class="noteText">
    Once deeply engaged, a steady stream of small discoveries is guaranteed. But stay alert for the main chance that lies to the side. There will always be the possibility of a major strike, some wholly unexpected find, some little detail that catches your peripheral attention that might very well, if followed, enlarge or even transform the subject you have chosen. If you sense such a possibility, seize it. In science, gold fever is a good thing.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To make such success more likely, there is another quality in which you might or might not be well endowed but if not should at least try to cultivate. It is entrepreneurship, the willingness to try something daunting you’ve imagined doing and no one else has thought or dared. It could be, for example, starting a project in a part of the world neither you nor your colleagues have yet visited; or finding a way to try an already available instrument or technique not yet used in your field; or, even more bravely, applying your knowledge to another discipline not yet exposed to it.

    On the frontier of modern science, however, multiple skills are almost always needed to bring any new idea to fruition. An innovator may add a mathematician or statistician, a computer expert, a natural-products chemist, one or several laboratory or field assistants, a colleague or two in the same specialty—whoever it takes for the project to succeed becomes a collaborator. The collaborator is often another innovator who has been toying with the same idea, and is prone to modify or add to it. A critical mass is achieved and discussion intensifies, perhaps among scientists in the same place, perhaps scattered around the world. The project moves forward until an original result is achieved. Group thought has brought it to fruition.

    Although insects, spiders, mites, centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, proturans, pillbugs, nematodes, annelid worms, and other such lilliputians are ordinarily overlooked, even by scientists, they are, nonetheless the “little things that run the world.” If we were to disappear, the rest of life would flourish as a result.

    IT MAY SEEM to you that science, having grown so large and complex in fact and theory, would be a difficult profession to enter. Perhaps you worry that most of the opportunities in research and application are closed, that competition for the rest is tight and daunting, and most of the epics and big pictures have been filled in. You would be wrong. The researchers of my generation and others before you accomplished a lot. But they did not close all pathways and enter all unknown regions. Instead, they opened new ones. In science every answer raises more questions. I will ramp up that important truth to an exponential degree: in science every answer creates many more questions.

    Original discoveries, to remind you, are what count the most. Let me put that more strongly: they are all that counts. They are the silver and gold of science. Proper credit for them is therefore not only a moral imperative, but vital for the free exchange of information and amity within the scientific community as a whole. Researchers rightly demand recognition for all their original work, if not from the general public then from colleagues in their chosen field.

    You will make mistakes. Try not to make big ones. Whatever the case, admit them and move on. A simple error in reporting or conclusion will be forgiven if publicly corrected. (At least one leading journal has a special erratum section.) An outright retraction of a result will not cause permanent harm if done graciously, and especially with thanks to the scientist who reported the error with evidence and logical reasoning. But never, ever will fraud be forgiven. The penalty is professional death: exile, never again to be trusted.

    If you’re not sure of a result, repeat the work. If you don’t have the time or resources to do so, drop the whole thing or pass it on to someone else. If your facts are solid, but you’re not sure of the conclusion, just say as much. If you do not have the opportunity or resources to repeat and confirm your work, don’t be afraid to use words denoting timid uncertainty: “apparently,” “seemingly,” “suggests,” “could possibly be,” “raises possibility of,” “may well be.” If the result is worthwhile, others will either confirm or disprove what you think you found, and all will share credit. That’s not sloppiness. It’s just good professional conduct, true to the core of the scientific method.
